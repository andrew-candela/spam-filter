Simple Bayesian spam filter

Here is a spam filter I made largely following the instructions from 'Data Science from Scratch' by Orielly.

the_math.pdf goes into the math I used in more detail.  
filter_functions.py contains a class that will serve as the classifier.  
train_and_classify.py points the classifier at the email corpus and trains it. It then gives a trivial example of usage.
